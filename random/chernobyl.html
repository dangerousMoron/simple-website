<p>Its pretty clear that the underlying theme of HBO's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)">Chernobyl miniseries (2019)</a> is an allegory for the current post-truth era we are experiencing. Soviet cover-ups and lies are stand-ins for the current administration's flagrant,  mendacious disregard for reality. It is even more relevant with our handling of COVID-19. This is evident in the opening lines of the first episode <code>1:23:45</code> with the rhetorical question posed:</p>

<!-- <pre><code> -->

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the cost of lies?</p>
  
  <p>It's not that we'll mistake them for the truth.
  The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all.
  What can we do then?
  What else is left but to abandon even the hope of truth, and content ourselves instead...</p>
  
  <p>with stories.
  <!-- </code></pre> --></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are too many examples of lies and cover-ups in the miniseries to list them here (for now at least... ).</p>

<p>The series concludes with our Legasov musing:</p>

<!-- <pre><code> -->

<blockquote>
  <p>And this, at last, is the gift of Chernobyl.
  Where I once would fear the cost of truth, now I only ask:</p>
  
  <p>What is the cost of lies?
  <!-- </code></pre> --></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, you might say this is pretty obvious, which it is. But what I think its really talked about anywhere else is that we've been here before in a number of ways. Most obviously, and because I've seen it a couple times is <code>Inherit the Wind</code>. A play, turned movie, about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial">Scopes Monkey Trial</a>.</p>

<p>Inherit the Wind is a clever criticism of not only creationism and parochial bullshit, but also McCarthyism. Using a historical setting, much like <code>Chernobyl</code>. Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee use a major historical event to criticize a present day societal ill. In this case its the rabid anti-intellectual plague of anti-communist hysteria and McCarthyism.</p>

<p>I'm sure this will be an eloquent centerpiece in a later edition of <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, or god forbid <em>Salon</em>. Perhaps written by David Brooks, David Frum or perhaps Fareed Zakaria. But just remember, I thought of this first, and wrote it here first.</p>
